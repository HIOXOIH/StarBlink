# ðŸ’ª Upgrade

## Overview

All miners start at level 1, and creating a miner is free. But upgrading a miner costs about 0.035 SOL each time.

You can not only upgrade your own miner to increase its $starlicon production but also upgrade other players' miners to become a shareholder.

## Shareholder

When you upgrade another playerâ€™s miner (by clicking the "Upgrade" button in their miner Blink user interface), you become a **shareholder** of that miner. As a shareholder, you are entitled to:

1. **The protected portion of $starlicon gains from your upgrades will be split evenly between you and the miner owner.** For example, if another playerâ€™s miner is at level 9 and you upgrade it by 1 level, you will hold a 1/10\*50% share of the total, becoming a shareholder. If that miner produces 1000 protected $starlicon in an epoch, you can secure 50 $starlicon when collecting from that miner.
2. **When you steal $starlicon from a miner where you are a shareholder, you can steal more.** For details, see the [Collect section](collect.md).

## Daily Upgrade Limit

Each player can only upgrade the same miner a maximum of 10 times per day, whether it is their own miner or someone elseâ€™s.
