# 🪐 Decentralized Game

Every player has their own unique miner, with a distinct miner link. To upgrade or collect from a specific miner, you first need to find the miner's tweet on Twitter/X and then perform the upgrade or collect operation through the miner's Blink interface.&#x20;

Currently, **there is no centralized website** where you can upgrade or collect from all miners, nor is there a centralized site that displays all miners. This adds another layer of enjoyment to playing Star Blink.
