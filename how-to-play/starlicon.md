# ðŸŒŸ Starlicon

## Overview

When a player first displays their miner link on X/Twitter, the miner officially comes into existence. From the moment of its creation, $starlicon production follows a fixed 24-hour epoch cycle. $Starlicon produced during one epoch can only be collected at the start of the next epoch, reflecting the output from the previous epoch.

The $starlicon produced by a miner during an epoch is equal to the miner's level multiplied by the miner's Blink views.

Starlicon = Miner Level*MinerBlinkViews

## Miner Blink Views

Note that it is not "miner link views," but "miner Blink views". The distinction between miner link and miner blink is as follows:

* Miner blink views refer to the total number of times all users who have set up **Solana Actions/Blinks** view the miner on X/Twitter (only possible with Solana Blink). If you have not set up **Solana Actions/Blinks**, viewing a miner's tweet will not increase the miner Blink views.

**In each epoch, the $starlicon production is split into two categories: 50% is protected, and the remaining 50% is unprotected.** Unprotected $starlicon can be collected (or "stolen") by any other players. The amount of $starlicon a user can collect each time depends on the remaining unprotected $starlicon and the user's own miner level. For more details, [check here](collect.md).
